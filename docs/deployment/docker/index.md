The articles in this section cover deploying the PCS in a Docker environment. Pre-built images are available in the project's [Docker Hub repository](https://hub.docker.com/r/acmfsu/contestsuite). An example deployment intended for [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) and suitable for local development and testing purposes is available in the repository's [deploy directory](https://github.com/mmcinnestaylor/Programming-Contest-Suite/tree/main/deploy).
